'# ----- WHEAT -----
'# Description: An pseudo CVS for Excel since there is none. With two projects in Excel without an CVS,
'#              there must be at least a better way.
'# Author: FVMurillo
'# Copyright: There is none

'# ----- SETUP -----
'# Just import the files Wheat.bas, WheatLib.bas and WheatUtil.bas into your project along with
'# 'Microsoft Visual Basic for Application Extensibility' in your reference(Tools > References)
'# and your good to go.

'# ----- USAGE -----
'# The only module you should care about is Wheat because all of the commands are declared there.
'# The module acts tries to emulate a command line. For example 'git init' is 'Wheat.Setup' and
'# 'git commit' is 'Wheat.Export'. The preferred use is via the immediate window(Ctrl+G) and
'# and executing the Wheat module methods from there with some help from the code completion.
'# You could also use F5 to run the commands but that might be too impractical to scroll.
