<h2>SearchRouteApp</h2>
This is <strong>a simple application which search the most efficient route in VBA.</strong><br>
You can search the route after you input a origin place, a destination place and a name of the city to the Userform in Excel Sheets.<br>
This application uses the Google Maps API and I was able to learn how to use it through creating this app.
